The sky is awfully sunny for wintertime. The glare even pierces through the windows of this already brightly lit breakroom.
Shining... which reminds me:
Today is when real personalities shine out more than any other occasion. Getting to see new sides to your co-workers are one thing, but enhancing the only aspect they have is another. 
I suppose it is a positive that the structured facade of everyones day to day behaviour lets down a bit, I'm just afraid of what this scenario would be like tonight, outside, with at least quadruple the amount of shiny people.

... and he's the latter.
"If I wanted to gain weight, chips would not be the food of choice."
whipping cream is the recommended method.
As always this man will put all his focus on pointing out differences instead of coming with something new. How does his brain work?

He's telling me this? Then i suppose nothing of sense goes on in this mans head.

Syntax for DialogueWrite.


{ is used for monologue (isnt neccessary)
"" is used for actual talking

SONG #0
//Plays the song thats in musicList[0] inside AudioManager.

;;-Miguel Blix 
//Replace my name with the name of the character thats talking.

%%2, %%3, %%4
// This will trigger a choice box with 2, 3 or 4 choices depending on what you choose.

(number)#number
// Replace the number texts with actual numbers, lets take 1 for example.
// (1)#1  the (1) means that its the first choice you have to make in the game.
// the #1 means its the first choice in the choice selection.
// (1)#1 will now display dialogue if you picked the first choice in the first choice pick in the game.

(End Choice)
// Type this at the end of every choice to conclude its ending.

-+-
// This means that the dialogues end has reached, the dialogue box will close down when this is written.

char_charname_expression
[RIGHT]  //can also be [LEFT] or [MIDDLE]
[SLIDE UP] // this is to activate the sprite for a character and which side it will pop up on the screen
		 // and slide up is the animation of sliding up from the bottom of the screen


Heres and example of how we could use this syntax.
// Blank lines will be ignored and therefore they can be added to make it easier to read
// its also possible to make comments on blank lines, they will also be ignored by the system.

;;-Cheesus Crust            
Hello i am Cheesus Crust.  // This is dialogue, everytime theres a new line,
I am the cheesiest crust.  // it will be separated into the next dialogue box.
Do you like cheesy crust?.

%2						   // Considering we only used %2 instead of %3 or %4, there will only be 2 choices to make.
Yes						   // Changing the line will change make a new choice
No

(1)#1
char_cheesus_happy
[MIDDLE]
[SLIDE UP]
I knew i could trust you, i also love cheesy crust.   // This will display if you picked the first choice
(End Choice)

(1)#2
char_cheesus_shocked
[MIDDLE]
How dare you!?, how can you not like cheesy crust!?!. // This will display if you picked the second choice
(End Choice)

Anyways i will always love cheesy crust nonetheless of what you say.
